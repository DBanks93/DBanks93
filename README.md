- Hi, I’m @ZonicoGaming
- I currently can code in Python, C#, JavaScript, VBScript, CSS and HTML (yes I know HTML isn't a proper language)
- I am learning C# and I am not fluent in it just yet
- I know a tiny bit of JavaScript and VBScript so don't ask me for help on it as will probably be just as clueless
- Python is my main go to language  
- I am working on a discord bot however it's highly inefficient due to it being a fun side project
